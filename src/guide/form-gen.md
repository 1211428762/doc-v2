# Problems

With a typical toB system, there is a certain amount of duplicate form form pages, and when the system is maintained by more than one person the following pain points may occur: (for repetitive tasks only)

- Members develop at different paces and have inconsistent code styles for pages of the same type;
- Members dont understand and dont use forms in the same way, and may each have their own templates with different content and lagging versions, so there is a certain cost of understanding and communication when maintaining each other's modules or code reviews.
- Repetitive workload, time-consuming and inefficient
- When trying to modify the system, but due to the lack of a unified design, it is not possible to realize the effect of changing one place and the whole set.
- Duplicate pages, difficult to access low-code tools

## Example

The following provides ideas; times have changed, technology has evolved rapidly, and better programs surely exist.

The idea of simplifying repetitive tasks to ensure quality and efficiency while tapping into expanding oneself is a growth mindset in most industries.

Of course there are already low-code tools on the market, but since there is a bit of a barrier to use, this example can be an introductory tool for low-code tools, or it can facilitate subsequent upgrades to drag-and-drop, as a transition.
